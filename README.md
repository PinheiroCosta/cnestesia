# cnestesia (Work in Progress)
Lets C the sound

This is a music library to manipulate the sound frequency with colors.
The main goal is to provide a library that can input music notation and sound frequencies
and convert them to output light frequencies and their respective colors.

It is actually possible to see the sound? Let's C for ourselves!

## Implemented Features
- return musical pitch notation of a given frequency based on the tempered scale (440Hz = A4)
- print the musical chromatic scale of a given frequency
- return the previous and next semitone of a given frequency
